Project description: Shogi, the most popular chess variant in Japan; shō 将, meaning general, and gi 棋, boardgame. We will simulate 2 player shogi in processing– this entails a displaying of the board and all 40 pieces, along with their unique movements. We will implement a turn system and a check and checkmate system as required in a game of chess. We will also obey the special edge cases involved with the shogi drop rule*. In acknowledgement that only 1/6th of the people in Japan know the rules of Shogi, and therefore even less in Stuyvesant, we will offer a visual tutorial in processing that can be accessed through a button.
